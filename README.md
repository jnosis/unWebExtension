# unWebExtension

Tool for building Web Extension with Deno.

This tool is inspired by [bext](https://deno.land/x/bext) and [npm:@types/chrome](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/chrome).

NOTE: Currently in developments for only [unMute](https://github.com/jnosis/unMute).
